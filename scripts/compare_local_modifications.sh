#
# Full description
# ================
# - executes GF_standalone.sh script
# - run binay comparison between grads .gra files
# - run grads diff comparison of variables outt1, outt2 and outt3
# - run scripts
#
#
# Instructions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# - First of all (once):
#
#   - The base results are reference files generated before for comparison. Must be at ../dataout__compare_local_modifications. 
#     So, execute:
#          
#     $ ./GF_Standalone.sh
#     $ copy -rf ../dataout ../dataout__compare_local_modifications
#
# - Now you can execute this script:
#
#   $ ./compare_local_modifications.sh
