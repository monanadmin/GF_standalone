#
# Full description
# ================
# - executes GF_standalone.sh script
# - run binay comparison between grads .gra files
# - run grads script to compare all variables of all levels of files that fails binary comparison.
# 
#
#
# Instructions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# - First of all (once):
#   - The base results are reference files generated before for comparison. Parametrize then in "DIR_REF" variable. 
#
# - Now you can execute this script:
#   $ ./compare_local_modifications.sh
#
#
# History
